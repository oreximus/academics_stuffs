## General Guidelines

 - **Prepare for Core Sections**: which comprises **MATH** and **Learnability & Aptitude**.
    - Review the key concepts and topics covered in each section to ensure you have a solid foudation.

- **Focus on balanced preparation**: While it's important to have a strong understanding of Maths, Learnability, and Aptitude, make sure you allocate your study time proportionally based on the weightage of each section. Give equal importance to each area and avoid neglecting any particular section.

- **Enhance your learnability**: It's checks the ability of yours to understand a new topic in a well manner. To improve this area focus on *critical thinking*, *information processing*, and *learning strategies*.
    - Engage in activities that require you to learn new concepts or acquire new skills, and reflect on you learning process.

- **Time management**: Since the test may have a time limit, practice managing your time effectively. Work on improving your speed and accuracy in solving problems to ensure you can complete all sections within the allocated time. Allocate sufficient time to each section based on its weightage.

- **Stay calm and focused**: On the day of the test, maintain a calm and focused mindset. Avoid getting overwhelmed by the pressure and focus on each question one at a time.

    1. Number Theory
    2. Exponentials and Logarithms
    3. Probability and Statistics
    4. Permutation and Combinations
    5. Ratio and Proportion
    6. Sets (Venn Diagrams)

## Learning Ability Testing

- In this section of test, a specific concept is explained and based on that a question is asked. The purpose of this section is to evaluate the understanding of the concept and ability to apply it to various problem-solving scenarios.

- Assessing aptitute and potential in the given subject matter. Therfore pay closer attention to the concept explanation and try to understand it thoroughly.

- The questions that follow will test comprehension of the concept and ability to apply it to various scenarios.
